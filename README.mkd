# Napkin v1.5

ess!)

### Code
The project can be compiled on a system supporting `latexmk` and `asymptote`,
with a sufficiently recent version of TeX Live.
You'll need to `mkdir asy`, then simply run `latexmk`.
(Or, see `.travis.yml` for the instructions that Travis CI uses to compile.)

*Pull requests are welcome!*
You can email corrections directly to me as well.
